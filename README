Programming challenge for Sortable.

Dependencies: gson 2.4 (included in jar)

Instructions
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Run the compiled jar in a folder that contains the folder "input" that 
contains "products.txt" and "listings.txt" input files as well as a "settings" 
folder that contains "CompanyAlias.json" and "ParsingRegex.json"

java -jar sortableJ.jar

Path to input products file: -Dproducts="input/products.txt"
Path to input listings file: -Dlistings="input/listings.txt"
Path to input Company Alias file: -Daliases="settings/CompanyAlias.json"
Path to input Company Alias file: -Dregex="settings/ParsingRegex.json"
Path to directory where output will be generated: -DoutputDir="output"


ParsingRegex.json
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sets the "Strong" and "Weak" regular expressions used for parsing titles.

strongRegex: String of characters in a title that are always replaced with white space (delimiters).
weakRegex: String of characters in a title that can be replaced with white space or removed entirely (optional characters).

Note: Be sure to escape Special JSON characters like quotes

Default value
{
	"strongRegex":",\"'`/()[]",
	"weakRegex":"-"
}


CompanyAlias.json
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A list of manufacturer names matched to an array of lowercase strings of alternate names a company may be known as in the listings file

eg. Hewlett Packard products are all listed under manufacturer="HP" in products.txt but can either be "HP" or "Hewlett Packard" in listings.txt
To treat these manufacturers as the same manufacturer, add the following to CompanyAlias.json

Note: It is not not necessary to add in long form names like "Samsung Camera" vs. "Samsung" as long as the products manufacturer is a substring of the listings manufacturer.

{
	"companyName":"hp",
	"aliases":["hewlett packard"]
}

There is also a special companyName value "all" that allows certain manufacturers' listings to be included in the search for all other manufacturers products.
This is for listings that use catch all manufacturer names like "various"

{
	"companyName":"all",
	"aliases":["various", "----------------------------"]
}
